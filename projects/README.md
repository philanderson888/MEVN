## studemts

basic app to create a front end and back end and save and display data

- [mevn-01](students/mevn-01) raw boiler plate code with vue2 *This version does not do anything so pretty much can be skipped*
- [mevn-02](students/mevn-02-vue3-template) add one component file with router
- [mevn-03](students/mevn-03) add bootstrap navbar
- [mevn-04](students/mevn-04) add axios and further component for adding new records to database.  Develop the application to add the full back end api and the full front end application with CRUD operations - Create, Read, Update and Delete students.
- [mevn-05](students/mevn-05) final version
- [mevn-06](students/mevn-06) rebuild of [mevn-05](students/mevn-05) and adding online hosting for both the front end application and the back end mongo database (but not the back end api)

## login

mevn `login` app with `jwt authentication` 

- [login-01](login/login-01) to get started with the back end, to install `mongodb` and start building the `api`
- [login-02](login/login-02) finish the back end api and start on the front end - scaffold app and strip out boilerplate code
- [login-03](login/login-03) finish building out the front end and connect everything to the back end and finish working app
